# Elliptic Curves - Math 101: Understanding Secret and Public Keys

Elliptic curves are fascinating mathematical structures used in cryptography.
Let’s break down the basic concepts of **secret keys** and **public keys** and
their relationships. We’ll also explore **P-256**, one of the widely used
elliptic curves.

## Create a Secret Key (sk)?

A secret key is simply a number that is randomly chosen from a specific range.
This range is `[0, N]`, where `N` is a parameter associated with the elliptic
curve group. 

For the **P-256 curve**, the parameter `N` (order of the curve) is:  
**`N = 0xFFFFFFFF00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFBCE6FAADA7179E84F3B9CAC2FC632551`**  

This means your secret key is a random number between `0` and `N-1`. Mathematically:  
`sk = random(0, N)`

## Derive a Public Key (pk)?

Once we have the secret key, we use it to calculate the corresponding public
key. This is done by performing **scalar multiplication** of the secret key with
a special point called the **generator point (G)** of the elliptic curve.

For the **P-256 curve**, the generator point `G` is defined as:  
- **x-coordinate**: `Gx = 0x6B17D1F2E12C4247F8BCE6E563A440F277037D812DEB33A0F4A13945D898C296`  
- **y-coordinate**: `Gy = 0x4FE342E2FE1A7F9B8EE7EB4A7C0F9E162CBAC94E80C64E6DFB1391043E124222`

The formula for calculating the public key is:  
`pk = sk * G mod N`

Here:  
- `sk` is the secret key.  
- `G` is the group generator point `(Gx, Gy)`.  
- The result of the multiplication is a new point `(pk_x, pk_y)` on the elliptic curve.

## Additive Properties of Keys

Secret and public keys have some fascinating additive properties:

- You can **add two secret keys**, and their sum will give a new valid secret key:  
  `sk_c = sk_a + sk_b mod N`
- You can **add two public keys** together, and their result will be another valid public key:  
  `pk_c = pk_a + pk_b`

For example:  
If `sk_a` and `sk_b` are two secret keys, and you calculate their public keys as `pk_a` and `pk_b`, the new secret key `sk_c` will correspond to the public key `pk_c` computed via:  
`pk_c = pk_a + pk_b`.

## Multiplicative Properties of Keys

Keys are also related multiplicatively. You can multiply a **public key** by a **secret key** to get another valid public key:

- For example:  
  `pk_ab = sk_a * pk_b`  
  `pk_ba = sk_b * pk_a`

Interestingly, the results of these operations are equal:  
`pk_ab == pk_ba`  

This property arises from the underlying structure of elliptic curves and is central to cryptographic applications.
